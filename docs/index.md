**Bio++** is a set of C++ libraries for Bioinformatics, including sequence analysis, phylogenetics, molecular evolution and population genetics. Bio++ is Object Oriented and is designed to be both easy to use and computer efficient. Bio++ intends to help programmers to write computer expensive programs, by providing them a set of re-usable tools. 

An overview of the methods implemented is available on the [Bio++ Wiki](https://github.com/BioPP/bpp-documentation/wiki/The-Bio-plus-plus--Project)
